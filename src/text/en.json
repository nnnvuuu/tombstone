In the process of engraving, computer samples often change the font slightly, and the distortion is regrettable. Masters with Chinese roots can correct the blind spots of computers in the engraving process. Second, the choice of pattern. Choose a tombstone pattern and be full of business. If the tree is selected, it must have leaves, stems and rhizomes. Choose bamboo trees and bamboos to report safety and rise steadily. In addition, pine cranes, lions, lotus flowers, roses, winter plums, and monarch orchid are all good design choices. Third, the stone carving process. Stone carving is a specialized craft, and the lettering techniques include concave characters, convex characters, lace and so on. Pattern processing line engraving, deep engraving. The surface treatment is polished, sanded, natural grain, and so on. Different designs have different process applications. Fourth, portraits.
